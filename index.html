                <li class="information">
                    <strong>1936</strong> - On November 12th, Turing publishes the seminal paper
                    titled "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem," in which he
                    introduces the concept of a universal machine capable of solving mathematical problems.

                <li class="information">
                    <strong>1939</strong> - With the outbreak of World War II, Turing joins the
                    British war effort at Bletchley Park, working in the team that decrypts the codes of the Enigma
                    cryptographic machine used by the Nazis.

                <li class="information">
                    <strong>1940</strong> - Turing leads the team that develops the "Bombe," an
                    electromechanical machine to aid in breaking the Enigma codes, becoming crucial for the Allies
                    during the war.

                <li class="information">
                    <strong>1948</strong> - Turing works on designing a general-purpose digital
                    computer at the National Physical Laboratory in Manchester, known as the "Manchester Mark 1".

                <li class="information">
                    <strong>1950</strong> - Turing publishes a paper titled "Computing Machinery and
                    Intelligence," where he proposes the "Turing Test" as a measure of a machine's intelligence.
                </li>
                <li class="information">
                    <strong>1952</strong> - Alan Turing is convicted of "gross indecency" after
                    admitting to a homosexual relationship. He undergoes hormone therapy as an alternative to
                    imprisonment, which severely affects his physical and mental health.
